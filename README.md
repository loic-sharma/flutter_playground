# Flutter playground

The following are experiments that I hope to upstream to Flutter:

Directory | Description
-- | --
[`container2/`](./container2/) | `Container2`, a drop-in replacement for `Container` that fixes `Container`'s [state loss problem](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/161698).
[`flutter_analyzers/`](./flutter_analyzers/) | Dart analyzer plugin for Flutter.
[`flutter_styled/`](./flutter_styled/) | `Styled`, a widget that makes it easier to style a child widget.
[`inherited_value/`](./inherited_value/) | `InheritedValue`, a widget that makes it easier to pass values down the widget tree.
[`render_composed_box/`](./render_composed_box/) | `RenderComposedBox`, a render object that makes it easier to compose render objects.
[`state_builder/`](./state_builder/) | `StateBuilder`, a widget that makes it easier to store state.
