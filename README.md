# Flutter playground

The following are experiments that I hope to one day upstream
to Flutter:

* [`container2/`](./container2/) - `Container2`, a drop-in replacement for `Container` that fixes `Container`'s [state loss problem](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/161698).
* [`flutter_styled/`](./flutter_styled/) - `Styled`, a widget that makes it easier to style a child widget.
* [`inherited_value/`](./inherited_value/) - `InheritedValue`, a widget that makes it easier to pass values down the widget tree.
* [`render_composed_box/`](./render_composed_box/) - `RenderComposedBox`, a render object that makes it easier to compose render objects.
* [`state_builder/`](./state_builder/) - `StateBuilder`, a widget that makes it easier to store state.
